#MNistNeuralNet
This folder contains a demonstration which I have built which trains a neural network on the MNIST data set which can be found from this link http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
The data was then transformed into image matricies using code written by Standford http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Using_the_MNIST_Dataset
